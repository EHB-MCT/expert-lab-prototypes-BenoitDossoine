# Portfolio

## Introduction

This portfolio was created in the context of the course "Expert Lab" at the Erasmushogeschool Brussel. It is a collection of all my previous works, and is a visual and audible voyage through my universe.

This portfolio is hosted on my [website](https://www.benoitdossoine.be).

## Technical stack

Here's a brief overview of the technology stack this portfolio uses:

* This prototype uses the [React](https://www.reactjs.org) framework.
* The 3D elements were created with [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction).
* The stars, the floating animation of the tiles and the positional audio were created using the helper functions from [drei](https://drei.pmnd.rs/).
* The animation of the 3D elements was created with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and their [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/) plugin.
* Icons were imported from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
